## Introduction

React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed and maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies, React allows you to create dynamic and interactive web applications with ease. React's key feature is its component-based architecture, which promotes reusability, maintainability, and performance.

## Features

- **Component-Based:** React encourages the creation of reusable components, making it easy to manage and update different parts of your application independently.

- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM, resulting in improved performance.

- **Declarative Syntax:** React's declarative syntax makes it easier to understand and control how your UI appears.

- **One-Way Data Flow:** React enforces a one-way data flow, ensuring that data changes are predictable and easier to debug.

- **React Ecosystem:** A vibrant ecosystem of third-party libraries, tools, and extensions extends React's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using React.js, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your development machine.

- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.

## Getting Started

To start using React.js, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:**
   You can create a new React application using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app). Run the following command to create a new project:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
